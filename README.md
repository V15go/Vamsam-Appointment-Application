## Approach 
Through my visits to the hospital regarding the website, IÂ noticed many patients get queued up with doctors, so IÂ gave an idea of an appointment application through which patients could fix appointments and the doctor meetups made easy. The hospital believed and gave me thisÂ opportunity. Where first presented a beta version of the application, where testing underwent by known engineers, from that designed a really cool application with addon features and user-friendly UX design.
